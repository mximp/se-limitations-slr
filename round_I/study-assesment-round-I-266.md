# STUDY ASSESSMENT - ROUND I

Please replace '???' (triple question mark) in form below with respective answers. 
Note that this round doesn't assume deep dive into all datails of the paper materials.
All the answers are supposed to be found within Abstract and Introduction sections if present. 
Otherwise in other sections in skimming mode.

## Has the study raised any issues of Symbolic Execution?

Please examine the paper on the subject of mentioning issues/difficulties/challenges/etc. of Symbolic Execution.
  
5. (Yes/No): `Yes`

If you answered 'Yes' please provide references to the location(s) within the study supporting your answer:  
(add as many list items 5.x as required in format `page No., citation`. Remove unnecessary items)

5.1 `p.1, ... some characteristics of programs still pose significant challenges to test data generation techniques that use symbolic execution and constraint solving. These challenges present themselves in the form of path explosion, constraint complexity, dependency, and exception-dependent paths.`  
5.2 `p.1, ... several issues still pose significant challenges, i.e., path explosion, constraint complexity, dependency, and exception-dependent paths`  

## Has the study introduced any new technique within Symbolic Execution field?

Please examine the paper on the subject of mentioning any technique/approach/method related to Symbolic Execution.
  
6. (Yes/No): `No`

If you answered 'Yes' please provide below references to the location(s) within the study supporting your answer:  
(add as many list items 6.x as required in format `page No., citation`. Remove unnessesary items)

## Has the study suggested any formal or informal proof of the limitations mentioned?

Please examine the paper on the subject of mentioning any description or references to
formal or empirical proof justifying any of Symbolic Execution problems.
  
7. (Yes/No): `Yes`

If you answered 'Yes' please provide below references to the location(s) within the study supporting your answer:  
(add as many list items 7.x as required in format `page No., citation`. Remove unnessesary items)

7.1 `p.1, ... we used a statistical tool to understand the frequency of methods that present the many possible combinations of the studied characteristics`  
7.2 `p.1, ... we used a data visualization tool to explore the distribution of methods whose path constraints share similar structures`
